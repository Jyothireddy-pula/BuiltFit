## 🧱 Architecture

The app is built in **Flutter** and uses:

- `Bloc` for state management in critical flows  
- `Hive` for local data persistence  
- `flutter_localizations` for i18n  
- `fl_chart` for rich visual statistics  
- `Provider` selectively where simpler listening is enough

The structure follows clean separation of UI, logic, and data layers with modular widgets and reusable components.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Unit and widget tests are located in the `test/` directory.  
To run tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

More tests and coverage will be added in future releases.

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If you run into issues:

- Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`
- Ensure you're using the correct Flutter version (`3.10+`)
- Check emulator/device setup and permissions
- Watch the logs with `flutter run -v`
